# Elevation

Every component has an elevation, each level of elevation is donated by a slight tonal change to lighter (closer to the sun) and an increasing drop shadow.

All interactive elements increase their elevation by 2 levels upon user interactions such as hover

No component can have a default elevation of level 4 or 5, these are reserved for interactions for components with a default level of 2 or 3

| Elevation level | design tokens | Components with default elevation at this level |
